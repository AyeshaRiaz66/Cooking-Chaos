# Cooking-Chaos
🍔 Fast-Food Kitchen Simulation
Operating Systems Project
🚀 Overview

The Fast-Food Kitchen Simulation is an interactive project designed to demonstrate core Operating System concepts through a real-time kitchen model.

Instead of only explaining theory, this project visualizes how processes compete for resources, how synchronization works, and how deadlocks can occur — all inside a simulated fast-food kitchen environment.

This project was developed as part of our Operating Systems course under the guidance of Sir Ahsan Fiaz.

🎯 Objectives

Demonstrate Process Scheduling

Implement Synchronization using Semaphores

Simulate Resource Allocation

Illustrate Deadlock Creation and Handling

Provide a visual and practical understanding of OS concepts

🧠 Operating System Concepts Implemented
1️⃣ Process Scheduling

Each customer/order is treated as a process

Scheduling algorithms manage execution order

Demonstrates how CPU scheduling works in real systems

2️⃣ Synchronization (Semaphores)

Kitchen resources (e.g., stove, fryer, chef) are limited

Semaphores control access to shared resources

Prevents race conditions

3️⃣ Resource Allocation

Orders require multiple resources

Simulation shows how resources are requested and released

Demonstrates safe and unsafe states

4️⃣ Deadlock Handling

Simulates deadlock scenarios

Shows how circular wait conditions occur

Implements strategies to avoid or handle deadlocks

🏗️ How the Simulation Works

Customers place orders

Each order becomes a process

Processes request kitchen resources

Scheduler decides execution order

Semaphores manage shared resource access

System detects and handles potential deadlocks
